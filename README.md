# **Revolutionizing Dairy Practices Using Machine Learning**  

## **Project Description**  
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning to optimize dairy operations by applying classification algorithms such as:  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)**  
- **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)**   
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  

It evaluates model performance through:  
- Training scores  
- Testing scores  
- Error rates  
- Accuracy of classifiers  

No IoT devices are used, relying purely on data-driven approaches.

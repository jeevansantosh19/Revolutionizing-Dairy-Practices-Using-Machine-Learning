> **Revolutionizing Dairy Practices Using Machine Learning**

**Project Description**
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning to optimize dairy operations by applying classification algorithms like KNN, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and SVM. 
It evaluates model performance through training scores, testing scores, error rates, and the accuracy of classifiers. No IoT devices are used, relying purely on data-driven approaches.

**Workflow**
1. Data Collection
Gathered a dataset relevant to dairy operations for analysis and model building.

**2. Data Preprocessing**
Encoded categorical columns to convert them into numerical format.
Standardized numerical columns for consistent scaling.

**3. Model Development**
Implemented classification algorithms:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**4. Model Evaluation**
Evaluated models using training scores, testing scores, error rates, and accuracy.

**Features**
Classification-based analysis for optimizing dairy operations.
Performance metrics include accuracy, error rates, and generalization capabilities.
No reliance on IoT devices, focusing solely on machine learning techniques.

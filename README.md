> **Revolutionizing Dairy Practices Using Machine Learning**

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning to optimize dairy operations by applying classification algorithms such as:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
It evaluates model performance through:

Training scores
Testing scores
Error rates
Accuracy of classifiers
No IoT devices are used, relying purely on data-driven approaches.
